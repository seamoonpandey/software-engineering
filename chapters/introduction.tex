\section{Background Theory}

The ePurano application is designed as a platform to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions of secondhand items. Recognizing the growing demand for sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to purchasing new products, ePurano aims to create a seamless, user-friendly experience for both buyers and sellers in the secondhand market. The application will provide functionalities such as item listings, user profiles, secure messaging, payment processing, and review systems to ensure trust and transparency between users.

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the development of ePurano, detailing functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, user interfaces, and the technological stack. The objective is to ensure a clear understanding of the application's capabilities, constraints, and performance expectations, providing a solid foundation for the development and deployment phases.

ePurano's mission is to empower individuals to efficiently buy and sell pre-owned goods, fostering a community-driven marketplace that promotes sustainability and economic efficiency. This document serves as a roadmap to guide the project team in delivering a robust and reliable platform that meets the needs of its users while adhering to industry standards and best practices.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to outline the requirements for the development of ePurano, a platform designed to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions of secondhand items. This document aims to ensure a clear understanding of the application's capabilities, constraints, and performance expectations, providing a solid foundation for the development and deployment phases.

\section{Scope}

ePurano is an application platform that enables users to buy and sell secondhand items in a seamless, user-friendly environment. The application will provide functionalities such as item listings, user profiles, secure messaging, payment processing, and review systems to ensure trust and transparency between users. The goal is to empower individuals to efficiently buy and sell pre-owned goods, fostering a community-driven marketplace that promotes sustainability and economic efficiency.

\section{Overview}

The ePurano platform will be developed using the Waterfall software development model, a linear and sequential approach ideal for projects with well-defined requirements. This model ensures systematic execution through the following phases:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item \begin{description}
        \item[Requirements Analysis] Gather and document all requirements for the ePurano platform.
    \end{description}
    \item \begin{description}
        \item[System Design] Outline the architecture and detailed design based on the requirements.
    \end{description}
    \item \begin{description}
        \item[Implementation] Develop the platform according to the design specifications.
    \end{description}
    \item \begin{description}
        \item[Integration and Testing] Conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality and reliability.
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

Using the Waterfall model, the ePurano development team aims to deliver a robust and fully functional platform in a structured and predictable manner.
